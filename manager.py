"""
This is just a way of adding commands that we can use in the cmd module.

We already created manager (in the init) so that it can init/up/downgrade the db;
(We can run all of the db creation / migration functions from here if we wish.)

Now we add other objects so we can access via cmd line;
e.g. app, db, Member etc.

0. Hash out references to debug in the __init__; seems like the ext vs - thing annoys it
1.Activate your venv (venv\scripts\activate).
2. Then (just like with db_create_migrate):
<venv> > python manager.py shell

I could only get to run by killing the usual
if __name__ == ...
(since cmd doesn't recognise)

NB Sometimes it doesn't like the flask.ext.package; just comment out.

Get rid of manager.run() and you can play around in the gui.
